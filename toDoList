 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        stuff to do after main stuff is done (aka polishing)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. setup validitors to check database each time you type on login to determine a valid username
        - setup samething for password?
        - use green/red outline animations

    2. Fix/finish setting up the way errors are handled for login validators
        - currently using "Passed"/"failed"
        - change to true/fase and submit errors in an array and pass it into a div on fail login attempt
    
    3. condense axios (from components signup/login) posts into a js file for cleaner code
